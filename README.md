# repros
Repros is the final project for the course "Advanced Software Engineering", in the context of my MSc. degree.
It's a Room Energy Profiling System (Android app + Arduino + 3rd-party weather services) with monitoring and
intervention capabilities. Note: the "intervention" is not fully functional, **but stands for a concept**.
The app collects environmental metrics from:
  a) smart-device's embedded sensors,
  b) Arduino microcontroller installed in a room and
  c) 3rd-party weather service, and monitors the Energy Profile of the room.
In addition, the app can control (intervene) electrical appliances, if necessary.
